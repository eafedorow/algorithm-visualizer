# AlgorithmVisualizer
Web applications for sequential visualization of algorithms

### Technologies stack:
1. Typescript;
2. React;
3. ReduxToolkit;
4. SCSS;
5. CSS-modules;

## Current functionality
### Sorting:
1. Sequential visualization of the algorithm with a setted delay value;
2. The ability to stop and continue sorting at any moment;
3. Generatin a new random data array;
4. Ability to change the delay value in the algorithm (lower delay, faster visualization);
5. Ability to choose different sorting algorithms;
6. Ability to change size of unsorted array;

#### List of available sorting algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort

### Pathfinding:
1. Sequential visualization of the algorithm with with a constant delay value;
2. Generatin a new random grid;
3. Ability to change the coordinates of the target node (Temporarily unavailable);
4. Ability to add and remove wall (unwalkable) nodes

#### List of available pathfinding algorithms:
1. A*
